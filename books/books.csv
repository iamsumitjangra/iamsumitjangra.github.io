But this book provides some good insights as it constituted stories of 15 different startups in different times.<br/><br/>One might not have heard about half of the startups but that's because they were started a long ago. Few stories are on startups that started in early 2000s to that's understandable. <br/><br/>Anyway the main crux of the stories is that startup is a journey with so many unpredictable ups and downs. And in that time you have to think creatively and out of the box. What worked for other might not work for you as there are lot of parameters in the equation and you cannot control most of them. ,,,1,0

Since I love reading mythology books, my opinion might be biased.<br/><br/>Unlike Ramayana and Mahabharata, you might not have heard about the characters of this book. I also had never heard about them. But the book has a lot of mystery and cliffhangers in every chapter as well at the climax. Sometime you might feel its a little overdone but that's how most of the books are written especially mythological fiction.

Apart from her, the main characters are her foster parents, her friends Max and Rudy and few of her neighbors. Throughout the book, you will see how people were trying to live happily during that time. For me personally the book is a little longer and it could easily have been 100-150 pages short.

But it helps you structuring all your thoughts and helping you create a framework. After all, negotiating is all about handling people on the other side.<br/><br/>Major insights are:<br/>1. Do not bargain over positions - In simple words, do not get attached to your position and then think of the bargain as an ego fight.<br/>2. Most of the time, it is not a zero-sum game. Both parties can benefit from a well-thought negotiation.<br/>3. Sometimes other parties are powerful or use some dirty tricks or playing unethically - In those cases, one needs to prepare accordingly and should not get frightened. <br/><br/>The last section where it tells answers to 10 questions people ask about getting to yes is good to read if not the book.",,,1,0

Others who have money say time is the most important. But do we really know what is most important and necessary? A few days ago I finished Man's search for meaning and I'll suggest it a must-read. For those who don't know, it's a masterpiece written by Victor E. Frankl -  a Psychiatrist, based on his own and his patient's experiences in Nazi death camps. During this time he also introduced logotherapy (logos is the Greek word for meaning). <br/><br/>So what is logotherapy and how it is beneficial? According to Victor Frankl, the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Whether we have money or time, if we do not have meaning in life, we will not find happiness. <br/><br/>                    Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'.<br/>                                                                            - Friedrich Nietzsche <br/><br/>We all can see in our daily life that one event can be very joyful for one person, and at the same time, it can taste bitter to someone else. It all depends on if that event provides any meaning to us. So how can we possibly find what is the meaning of our life? Obviously, it's not written somewhere (Apart from religious books, but since I am more of an atheist, we will leave that part). In the book, he gave many examples of people who just gave up their meaning and after that did not have any drive to survive. In 2003, Aron Ralston, who survived a canyoneering accident by cutting off his own arm, himself said that his love for his family was the reason which made him fight for his survival. Meaning to your life can be derived from anything, your love for family and friends, helping other people, building a company to solve a problem at a large scale, etc. But the problem arises when you are no longer to do what gives you meaning. That time remember one thing, when we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves. One can take everything from you but one thing: your attitude in any given set of circumstances. In Nazi death camps too, people who wanted to see their family or a scientist who wanted to finish a word he couldn't finish were the ones to survive. Once you let go of the reason which provides you meaning, there is no hope. <br/><br/>There was one more example. An old man was very sad in his life as his wife died. He thought of remaining life just as suffering. But he was told that what if he died earlier than his wife. In that case, his wife has to suffer. So basically his suffering was the price he was paying so that his wife did not have to suffer. At that moment his perception changed towards what he was calling as suffering. In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.<br/><br/>So It does not really matter what we expect from life, but rather what life expected from us. We need to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who are being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.",,,1,0
